**Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE)**
The DRIVE database is for comparative studies on segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images. It consists of 40 photographs out of which 7 showing signs of mild early diabetic retinopathy.

**Cervical Cancer Screening**
In this kaggle competition, you will develop algorithms to correctly classify cervix types based on cervical images. These different types of cervix in our data set are all considered normal (not cancerous), but since the transformation zones aren't always visible, some of the patients require further testing while some don't.

**Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC)**
Preliminary clinical studies have shown that spiral CT scanning of the lungs can improve early detection of lung cancer in high-risk individuals. Image processing algorithms have the potential to assist in lesion detection on spiral CT studies, and to assess the stability or change in lesion size on serial CT studies. The use of such computer-assisted algorithms could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spiral CT lung screening, as well as lower costs by reducing physician time needed for interpretation.
